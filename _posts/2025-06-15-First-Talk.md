This post is around a year late, but I still wanted to write a bit on my first experience of giving a talk at a workshop. 

When I was finishing my master thesis, the opportunity to submit my work to the 4th Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Cryptography in Z端rich came along. After some thinking, I decided to try. This was a good moment to experience if I would enjoy to submit and present my work. That said, I submitted my work and waited.

After a few weeks, I got the email my work was accepted for a 15 minute talk. I haven't travelled that much yet in my life, so going abroad for a 15 minute talk got me nervous. If I would go abroad anyway, I decided to add a few extra days to explore the city. I asked a good friend to tag along for this mini-holiday.

We booked a hotel and a Flixbus, so we were ready to go! After a 14 hour drive through the night, we arrived in Z端rich. Such a beautiful city! We rested this day such that I was full of energy for the next day during my talk.

When I arrived at the University of Z端rich, I was blown away by the historical building in which the University was located. Here I would present my talk!

Being nervous for the talk is obviously part of the job, but it went quite well for a first experience. After the workshop, I had plenty of time to relax and see the city.

We visited the botanical garden of the University, two musea, the huge city park and the Rheinfalls. For a first conference experience, I think it went well and I enjoyed it very much!
